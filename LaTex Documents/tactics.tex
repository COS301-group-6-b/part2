\subsubsection{Scalability tactics}
Thread Pooling: Will assign a thread to each client (buzz space user) so that the system may become multi-threaded. This will improve concurrency and thus optimize overall scalability of the system for larger user groups\\
\\  
Paging: Resource reuse, within the buzz space system, is also essential to the scalability of the system. The databases managing the resources will be optimized via paging in three ways.These are deferred joins, maintaining a page/place column and paging without discarding records.\\
\subsubsection{Security}  
Authentication: Will be used to log users in, this will allow us to only let students use the Buzz system.\\
\\
Request/connection dropping: This will be used to discourage attacks from bots when large failed attempts are made to access the system.\\
\subsubsection{Performance}
Database Indexing: When Database indexing is used there will be less of a load on the servers as when requests are made the database entry is easier to find.
