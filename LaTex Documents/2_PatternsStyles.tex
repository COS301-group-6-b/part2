\subsubsection{Hierarchical}
Description: A structural pattern based on a recursive containment hierarchy similar to the composite pattern.\\
\\
Quality Requirements using hierarchical pattern:\\
\\
Scalability: Hierarchical structure is considered because it can achieve high-level scalability in for example traversing databases used by the buzz system (Solms, 2014).\\
\subsubsection{Master-Slave}
Description: A pattern used in large-scale concurrent processing environments. The master distributes work between slaves, slaves do the main work while the master manages the  overall process (Solms, 2014). \\
\\
Quality Requirements using master-slave pattern:\\
\\
Scalability: Can be achieved by splitting work into independent sub-tasks executed by independent nodes.\\
\subsubsection{Black-Boarding}
Description:\\
\\
Quality Requirements using black-boarding pattern:\\
\\
Scalability: Black-boarding makes achieving scalability across processors, subject to scalable implementation of the blackboard, easy (Solms, 2014).\\
