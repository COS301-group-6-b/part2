\subsubsection{Scalability tactics}
Thread Pooling: Will assign a thread to each client (buzz space user) so that the system may become multi-threaded. This will improve concurrency and thus optimize overall scalability of the system for larger user groups\\
\\  
Paging: Resource reuse, within the buzz space system, is also essential to the scalability of the system. The databases managing the resources will be optimized via paging in three ways.These are deferred joins, maintaining a page/place column and paging without discarding records.
